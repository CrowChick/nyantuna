nyantuna
========

A spoof of nyan cat made with CSS3 animations and the Web Audio API (ostensibly with fallbacks for less cutting-edge browsers). Featuring the ineffable [Tuna P. Katz](http://www.rachelthegreat.com/comics/the-naming-of-tuna-page-1/ "A brief comic history of Tuna.!").

You can [see it in action on rachelnabors.com](http://www.rachelnabors.com/animation/nyantuna "Nyan Tuna in action! Nyan Nyan Nyan!")

The goal: make it work efficiently in all current browsers and perfect it's gloriousness.
